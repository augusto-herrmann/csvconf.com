# Buenos Aires (BA) City - Info for visitors 

_The following information was prepared by a Buenos Aires local, Maite Herrero, as an informal resource for csv,conf attendees. Thank you, Maite!_

# Safety tips


## Useful phone numbers

**For any criminal episode: 911.** If you can’t communicate in Spanish, you can ask for the “tourist police” once an officer picks up the phone. 

**For medical emergencies: 107.** If provided, you can also call the emergency number of your travel insurance. Universal Assistance and AssistCard are the most popular in Argentina. 

Gender violence: The hotline number 144 is available 24/7, 365 days a year, to provide specialized care to women who have experienced gender-based violence. Trained specialists are available to offer advice, information, and support at any time.


## Tips for staying safe 

We suggest that you always keep your belongings close to you, use authorized taxis, and make sure that your bags or backpacks are securely closed. It's advisable to stay on well-lit streets during nighttime and avoid wearing flashy jewelry or expensive accessories. Do not use your phone on the streets. In case of an emergency, dial 911. 

Please find more safety & security tips below. 

# Basics

## Money

The Argentine currency is the Peso ($; with 100 centavos in each peso). Cash is available in notes ($ 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000) and coins ($ 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1, 2, 5, 10). Credit and Debit cards are widely accepted in stores, restaurants, etc. The most accepted cards are Visa, American Express and MasterCard.

Argentina is experiencing hyperinflation. Sometimes you may be offered, or you can request, a 10% discount when buying with cash instead of credit and debit cards. You might want to bring USD cash and exchange this to Argentine Pesos in the hotel or locally. Argentina has an “official exchange rate” and an unregulated one called “blue” that might offer a better rate than the official (the gap is almost 100%). Do not change your money on the streets – it is a common scam. Instead, ask your local host to change your money. Exchange houses use the official exchange rate.

ATMs, known as ‘Cajeros Automáticos’, are available in Buenos Aires and a few other major cities to withdraw cash against a credit card. (An average of Pesos Argentinos $5,000.00 per day – **Please check it with your bank before traveling**). It might include an extra charge for withdrawing money from foreign accounts.

**Banking & Shopping Hours**: Banks are regularly open from Monday to Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Stores are open from Mondays to Fridays from 9:00 a.m. (some 9:30 or 10:00) to 8:00 p.m., and Saturdays from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Shopping malls open every day from 10:00 a.m. to 9 p.m.

## Access to internet

There is public wifi in many parts of Buenos Aires, provided for free by the Buenos Aires City Government. The connection is unsecured so you may wish to use a VPN. 

You can also use mobile data. If your mobile provider does not already allow you to roam in Argentina, some advice from travel blogs (e.g. [1](https://abrokenbackpack.com/argentina-sim-cards/), [2](https://www.phonetravelwiz.com/buying-a-sim-card-in-argentina-guide/), [3](https://www.traveltomtom.net/destinations/south-america/argentina/sim-card-buenos-aires)) is to buy a prepaid SIM (or “chip”) directly from one of the Argentinian mobile providers (Claro, Personal, Movistar) either in-store (you’ll need your passport for activation!) or online in advance. You can buy a SIM card from Personal at Efeifa airport, but apparently you can only pay by card (subject to official exchange rate) so you may be able to get the same deal for half the price if you can wait to buy from a store in the city in cash.

## Getting around in Buenos Aires

**Transfer from Ezeiza National Airport:** there are many taxi and transportation services that you can hire at the airport. Most of the time, you pay a fixed price before taking the ride. It’s advisable to book your taxi in advance using [Tienda Leon](https://www.tiendaleon.com/), which offers door-to-door service and transport to and from the airport

**Subte (Underground train network):** is the quickest way to get around in Buenos Aires. There are six lines (A, B, C, D, E and H) that connect the city's main avenues. The B line takes you to Novotel, where the conference will take place. You have to hop off at Callao or Uruguay stations and walk a couple of blocks.  

**Bus:** They run 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and cover the whole city. Tell the bus driver where you are headed (give the name of the crossroad nearest to where you wish to get off) and he will select the correct fare. The "Metro Bus" is a bus rapid transit system using dedicated bus lanes to cut journey times on several of the city's main arteries. Several Metrobus stops have free WiFi access. 

You can find information about when buses or subways are arriving and how to get to any place using google maps or **Moovit**: Search for any destination and get turn-by-turn directions; very useful for public transportation (Bus, train and metro).

**SUBE card:** to take any bus or metro train, you must pay with a SUBE card, which is a rechargeable magnetic card that allows payment for the different means of public transportation in Buenos Aires; you can charge it with credit in the metro station or in most drugstores (you can only charge your card with Argentinian pesos, and the fee for each ride is approximately ARS$50). [Here’s a map of all the locations where you can buy your SUBE card](https://tarjetasube.sube.gob.ar/SubeWeb/WebForms/admin/views/mapa-sube.aspx?id=1).

**For car rides:** While Uber is available in Argentina, the service isn’t actually legal, and therefore, it has no legal or security control. You can use “[CABIFY](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/cabify-tu-chofer-privado/id476087442)” instead: download the app, it works the same way as Uber, and cash payments are recommended.

## Where to stay?

**AIRBNB:** it offers a wide range of prices and accommodations. You may wanna book a place near the CSV conference, which is located in the San Nicolas neighborhood. 

**IBIS HOTEL:** This hotel, which is next door to the conference venue, provides excellent service at an affordable price. It’s located in Ave Corrientes 1344. You can find additional information by visiting their website: 

[https://all.accor.com/hotel/6502/index.es.shtml?utm_campaign=seo+maps&utm_medium=seo+maps&utm_source=google+Maps](https://all.accor.com/hotel/6502/index.es.shtml?utm_campaign=seo+maps&utm_medium=seo+maps&utm_source=google+Maps) 


## General advice on food & drink

Fruits and vegetables are safe to eat. Milk and butter are pasteurized. Argentine beef and wine are the two musts when visiting Argentina. Breakfast at cafes is usually served until 10 am; lunch runs from 12:30 to 3 pm (locals show up at 1-1:30); dinner from 8:30 to midnight (locals dine as from 9 pm and until late hours). Several restaurants stay open all night, catering to the after-theater and nightclub crowd. It is perfectly safe to drink tap water in Buenos Aires city, but not so in the countryside. However, it is advisable to drink mineral water (sparkling or still), as every organism is different, and tap water could cause stomach digestion problems.

Please see below for recommended places to enjoy Argentine cuisine.

# Additional safety & security tips

In general, Buenos Aires is a bustling city at all hours, but there are parts of town that will feel unsafe at certain times of the day. Avoid them or take a radio taxi/CABIFY.  Some areas where you should be extremely careful are La Boca, San Telmo, Retiro, some parts of Balvanera and Constitución. Outside tourist streets, you should be careful even during the day. 

Using your common sense is good advice anywhere.

Please take this advice during your visit:

* If you are being robbed, don’t play hero, do not offer resistance. Hand over all material objects they want to steal from you because the criminal can react violently.
* Don’t wear expensive jewelry in public, do not wander with cameras and equipment in dangerous areas or when alone, and do not use your phone on the streets. Always ask your local host if you have any doubts regarding safety at certain locations.
* In bars and restaurants don’t leave your phone lying on the table, especially if you’re on the sidewalk. Don’t leave your purse hanging from the back of the chair, it’s better to hang it from the little hooks under the table or leave it on your lap.
* Watch out for tag-team motorcycle thieves. A common trick for local thieves is to operate in teams of two on a motorcycle, and it is surprisingly effective. No terrain is inaccessible if you are a motochorro, or motorcycle thief, be it the sidewalk, bike lanes or even cafes. Motochorros have been videoed robbing tourists of their rental bikes and backpacks, and they are notorious for phone snatching.
* Although the La Boca and San Telmo neighborhoods are well-known tourist destinations, they are notoriously dangerous if you stray from the main tourist avenues, check with your local host before sightseeing alone and ask for recommendations. There have been violent robberies in the daytime as well as nighttime. Stay on the main streets in the tourist zone and use radio taxis/UBERs to and from the neighborhood.
* Scams involving yellow and black taxis have been reported at international airports and around Buenos Aires. Pre-arrange a ride or select one of the flat-rate “remise” services (private car with driver) from the airport. In town, use radio taxis from places like a hotel when possible, or use UBER and similar apps.
* Public transportation is largely safe to use. You’ll need to be wary of pickpockets, especially during crowded peak hours. Recommendations include: Wear your purse across your body, do not use your phone, it can get snatched. Only carry your essentials, leave important documents such as your passport at the Apartments.
* Buenos Aires city has a vibrant nightlife, full of clubs, restaurants and a vibrant cultural life. Recommendations include: Trust your instincts. If you feel uncomfortable in a situation, move towards a public place. Don’t accept drinks from strangers. Do not leave your drink unattended.
